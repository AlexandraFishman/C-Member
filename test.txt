hello alex, this is a test. im writing this from VSCODE. You still need to install that git extension though (the thing that pops up every time you open
VScode at the bottom right corner)
this is the video I used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cMWR-EGFuY&t=186s
and here is another video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ZW94SWchE

Before your first commit you will have to config your email address in the terminal using this:
git config --global user.email "ENTER EMAIL HERE"
At the video he doesnt tell you that after you select the master branch (at around 6:26) you will need to enter your username and password
at a box on the top and then click at the thing near the master branch in the blue bar bottom left. If you have any issues during the proccess text me
